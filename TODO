IMPROVEMENTS

* When running $ spec spec/ servers sometimes are not unbinded and some specs fail.

shared channel for a number of pids.
* Try to use Thread.critical instead of Queue.new to achive better performance.

FEATURES

* filters for messages (erlang-like receive() pattern-matching)
* passing particular objects through TCP
* resource discovery
* ring/chord protocol
* rack http server & http client
* unix sockets interface
* REv along with eventmachine backend

TASKS

* Benchmark against DRb.
